## Example1

Example1 demonstrates the usage of delegates with threads and cancellation tokens to simulate notification scenarios.

## Bookstore

The Bookstore namespace showcases how delegates can be used to process a collection of books, calculate average prices, and print book titles.

## Practice1

Practice1 module covers several exercises:
- **Question1:** Multicast delegates for calculating areas of shapes.
- **Question2:** Singlecast vs. multicast delegate behavior.
- **Question3:** Sorting integers using delegates.
- **Question4:** Event simulation with delegates.
- **Question5:** Lambda expressions with delegates.
- **Question6:** Bonus challenge on string manipulations using delegates.

## Program

The main program orchestrates the execution of Example1, Bookstore, and Practice1 modules to demonstrate delegate concepts in action.

## How to Use

To run the examples:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the solution in Visual Studio or your preferred IDE.
3. Navigate to `Program.cs` and uncomment the module you want to execute in the `Main` method.
4. Build and run the solution to observe delegate functionalities.

Feel free to explore each module and experiment with different scenarios using delegates in C#!
